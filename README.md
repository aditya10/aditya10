### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 
I work in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.cs.ubc.ca) with Prof. Leonid Sigal. My interests lie in multimodal vision-text 
models and graph-based techniques for image segmentation and object localization.

_Quick facts:_
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on multimodal computer vision research projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: message me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aditya.chinchure/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Tesla, Apple, or anything tech and photography!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I do photography as a hobby. My work has over 100 million views on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@adityachinchure).
